    anyone know how to set the width of a card to fill the size of its parent component?
    width: 100%(edited)
    Might just need to read the API to access the width of some nested component

    Click Email in the list and full message appears
    click x and viewing box goes away

        put an AppBar in a Card
        onClick for the table row, how exactly are you popping up a card? 
        I have something updating a state and then my code checks the 
        state to see if it should display, but don't know where to go from there

        I just have some global state stored in a context. Whenever I click an email, 
        it does a thing to that state that tells the card to appear.

        used a card and had it hidden by default until you click an email
